# This Project contains:

- `optimizers.py` - a script for generation of list of optimizers - parameters tuples.
- `experiment.py` - a script for execution coco benchmark on selected algorithm and its options.
- `main.py` - a file, that runs experiments with different max FEs for given algorithm-parameters pair.
- `time.sh` - a simple bash script to measure execution time for single experiment on one algorith-parameters pair with multiple max FEs limits.
- `report.txt` - a report generated by time.sh, its results indicates, that single experiment runtime is about 5h 30m.

In order to run `main.py`, single integer argument must be passed. This number should be greater or equal than 0 and lesser than 422.
It is an ID of algorithm-parameters pair to test.

HPC-based experiment can be performed by installation via:

```bash
uv sync
```
in case of uv installation, experiment runner can also be installed by:
```bash
pip install .
```
running experiments:
```bash
sbatch runner.slurm
```
